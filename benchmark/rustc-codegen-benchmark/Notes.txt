The log files:

rustc-*-backend-log.txt are for building pulldown-camrk benchmark in sightglass
with different variants of rustc compiler.


average compile time:

cranelift+superopt = 2.388 sec
cranelift original = 2.413 sec
llvm backend       = 3.06  sec


speed up compile time:
1) from cranelift original ->  cranelift + superopt = 1.24%
    ++ compile time reduced by 1.24%

2) from llvm backend ->  cranelift + superopt = 22.22%
    ++ compile time reduced by 22.22%

3) from llvm backend ->  cranelift original = 21.24%
    ++ compile time reduced by 21.24%

average run time:
cranelift + superopt = 0.0382 sec
cranelift original   = 0.0381 sec
llvm backend         = 0.0419 sec


speed up run time:
1) from cranelift original to crnaelift + superopt = 0%
    ++ no speedup, the run time is exact same

2) from llvm backend -> cranelift + superopt or cranelift original = 9.52%
    ++ execution time reduced by cranelift backend by 9.52%
